# Note!
As a demo, we use the Poppins from Google Fonts, if you want to use a font like Medium.com, you can change the Fonts import from [lines 132 - 135](https://github.com/elhakimyasya/Webium-Blogger-Template/blob/main/webium_theme.xml#L132:L185) with the fonts that are in the [fonts.css](https://github.com/elhakimyasya/Webium-Blogger-Template/blob/main/Fonts/fonts.css) file. Don't forget to also change the ```Poppins``` to ```sohne```.

But, we don't recommend using it.
